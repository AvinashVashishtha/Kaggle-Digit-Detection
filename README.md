# Kaggle-Digit-Detection
Identifying digits from images of handwritten numbers using Deep Learning Techniques

#Problem Statement:

Here, we need to identify the digit in given images. We have total 70,000 images, out of which 49,000 are part of train images with the label of digit and rest 21,000 images are unlabeled (known as test images).


#About Data:

The data set used for this problem is from the populat MNIST data set. Developed by Yann LeCun, Corina Cortes and Christopher Burger for evaluating machine learning model on the handwritten digit classification problem.
